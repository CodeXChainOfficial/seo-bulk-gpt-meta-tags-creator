> A Streamlit web application that connects to OpenAI's GPT-4 and generates titles and descriptions for SEO, whether for single use or in bulk

## ⚙️ How this app works.

This web application is designed for creating SEO-friendly titles and descriptions either individually or in bulk using .xlsx files

Benefits:

* The prompts and descriptions you provide to GPT go through two cleaning phases. The script removes stop words specific to your language and processes all verbs through a lemmatizer.
* The lemmatizer is a process that reduces words to their base or root form, which helps in simplifying and standardizing verb forms and makes it easier for language models like GPT to understand and generate text.
* By using the API, you can achieve approximately a 30% reduction in token usage, which translates to cost savings.
* You can efficiently create meta tags in bulk by uploading a .xlsx file. Each row in your file will generate a unique prompt based on the provided information, resulting in personalized * prompts for each URL.

## ☕ How to Use it

* Simply go to the [web application](https://seo-meta-tag-bulk-creator.streamlit.app/).
* Insert your API key;
* Choose your language;
* Insert any descriptions you have on your page or include them all in your .xlsx file.
* Bulk Create Meta Tags ✨.

### Work in Progress

This application is fully functional but still a work in progress.. I would appreciate any feedback on this application.
